          I live in Richmond, VA with my lovely wife, Meghann, my two sons, Braydan and Luke, and 
          my dog, Riley. We enjoy spending time together and being outdoors.

        I have been working at Genworth Finalcial for about 7 years. I started out working in operations as a long term 
        care claim representative. After a few years I moved into IT as a QA tester where I stayed for about 3 years. 
        After testing an in house developed .NET claims software, the copy decided to build a new workflow application using Pega. 
        After testing in Pega for about a year, I decided I wanted to spend my time developing the code instead of testing it. I 
        obtained my Pega Certified System Architect (CSA) and was hired as a developer. Since then, I have also obtained my 
        Certified Senior System Architect (CSSA) certifications. Since I don't have a background in computer science, I am really looking
        foward to learning some concepts that will help in my day to day activities and also help when I converse with members of other 
        at my job.

        In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, running around with my kids and spending time with friends drinking 
        over priced craft beer. I also really enjoy playing sports, especially golf and tennis.
