          I live in Richmond, VA with my lovely wife, Meghann, my two sons, Braydan and Luke, and 
          my dog, Riley. We enjoy spending time together and being outdoors.

        I have been working at Genworth Finalcial for about 7 years. I started out working in operations as a long term 
        care claim representative. After a few years I moved into IT as a QA tester where I stayed for about 3 years, until
         in 2018 when I transitioned to a developer role in Pega. I've obtained my Pega Certified System Architect (CSA) and 
         Certified Senior System Architect (CSSA) certifications.

        In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family and running around with my kids. I also really enjoy playing sports,
         especially golf and tennis.</p>
